This example problem is a variant of the BCF2SS problem that is distributed with MODFLOW-2005 and demonstrates the wetting and drying capability in MODFLOW 6. This problem is based on a MOFLOW-2005 problem (LPFSS) that uses the LPF Package instead of the BCF Package and explicit includes a confining unit (layer 2) between two aquifers (layers 1 and 3).   Layers 1 and 2 are convertible and can rewet.
