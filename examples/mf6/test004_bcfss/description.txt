This is the BCF2SS problem that is distributed with MODFLOW-2005.  This problem demonstrates the wetting and drying capability in MODFLOW 6. The MODFLOW 6 problem is constructed with two layers (like the MODFLOW-2005 model) but the thickness of the confining bed is included in model layer 2 and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of layer 2 is half that of model layer 2 in the MODFLOW-2005 model in order to calculate the correct horizontal conductance.
