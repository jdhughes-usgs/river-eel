This is also the first test problem presented in the MODFLOW-USG manual; however, it is represented using two separate structured models.  The models are connected using a Groundwater Flow to Groundwater Flow (GWF-GWF) Exchange.  These two models are solved simultaneously in the same matrix equations.  A ghost-node correction is also applied to improve the flow calculation between models.  A water mover is used to pump water from a provider MAW well in the child model and inject the water into a MAW well in the parent model.
