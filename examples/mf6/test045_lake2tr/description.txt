This is the lake-stream-aquifer interaction example problem (test simulation 2) from the Lake Package documentation (Merritt and Konikow, 2000).  This problem is simulated using the Lake (LAK) and Streamflow Routing (SFR) Packages in MODFLOW 6. The Mover (MVR) Package is also used to exchange water between the SFR and LAK Packages.
