This is also the first test problem presented in the MODFLOW-USG manual; however, it is represented using two separate structured models.  The models are connected using a Groundwater Flow to Groundwater Flow (GWF-GWF) Exchange.  These two models are solved simultaneously in the same matrix equations.  A ghost-node correction is also applied to improve the flow calculation between models.
