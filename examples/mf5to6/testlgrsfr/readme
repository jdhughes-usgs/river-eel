These files are from the "bigger_child" model used to compare 
example 1 in the LGR documentation.  The reason this is used is because the
number of rows is larger but the number of columns is smaller
so it has approximately the same number of refined cells.


The directory 'shared' contains the ex1 test case in the shared node version.

There are different LPF and zone files to explore different contrasts and 
configurations of heterogenity.  As it is set up currenlty, it is the ex1
heterogeneity from the LGR documentation.
