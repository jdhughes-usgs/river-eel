\item \texttt{PRINT\_INPUT}---keyword to indicate that the list of horizontal flow barriers will be written to the listing file immediately after it is read.

\item \texttt{maxhfb}---integer value specifying the maximum number of horizontal flow barriers that will be entered in this input file.  The value of \texttt{maxhfb} is used to allocate memory for the horizontal flow barriers.

\item \texttt{iper}---integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  \texttt{iper} must be less than \texttt{nper} in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The \texttt{iper} value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the \texttt{iper} value assigned for the previous block.

\item \texttt{cellid1}---identifier for the first cell.  For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, \texttt{cellid1} is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, \texttt{cellid1} is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then \texttt{cellid1} is the node numbers for the cell.  The barrier is located between cells designated as \texttt{cellid1} and \texttt{cellid2}.  For models that use the DIS and DISV grid types, the layer number for \texttt{cellid1} and \texttt{cellid2} must be the same.  For all grid types, cells must be horizontally adjacent or the program will terminate with an error.

\item \texttt{cellid2}---identifier for the second cell. See \texttt{cellid1} for description of how to specify.

\item \texttt{hydchr}---is the hydraulic characteristic of the horizontal-flow barrier. The hydraulic characteristic is the barrier hydraulic conductivity divided by the width of the horizontal-flow barrier. If hydraulic characteristic is negative, then it acts as a multiplier to the conductance between the two model cells specified as containing a barrier. For example, if the value for \texttt{hydchr} was specified as 1.5, the conductance calculated for the two cells would be multiplied by 1.5.
