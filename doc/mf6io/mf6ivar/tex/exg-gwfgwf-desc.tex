\item \texttt{auxiliary}---an array of auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided. Most auxiliary variables will not be used by the GWF-GWF Exchange, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  If an auxiliary variable with the name ``ANGLDEGX'' is found, then this information will be used as the angle (provided in degrees) between the connection face normal and the x axis.  Additional information on ``ANGLDEGX'' is provided in the description of the DISU Package.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_INPUT}---keyword to indicate that the list of exchange entries will be echoed to the listing file immediately after it is read.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that the list of exchange flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period in which ``SAVE BUDGET'' is specified in Output Control.

\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that cell-by-cell flow terms will be written to the budget file for each model provided that the Output Control for the models are set up with the ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' option.

\item \texttt{cell\_averaging}---is a keyword and text keyword to indicate the method that will be used for calculating the conductance for horizontal cell connections.  The text value for \texttt{cell\_averaging} can be ``HARMONIC'', ``LOGARITHMIC'', or ``AMT-LMK'', which means ``arithmetic-mean thickness and logarithmic-mean hydraulic conductivity''. If the user does not specify a value for \texttt{cell\_averaging}, then the harmonic-mean method will be used.

\item \texttt{VARIABLECV}---keyword to indicate that the vertical conductance will be calculated using the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell and the thickness and properties of the underlying cell.  If the DEWATERED keyword is also specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.  If these keywords are not specified, then the default condition is to calculate the vertical conductance at the start of the simulation using the initial head and the cell properties.  The vertical conductance remains constant for the entire simulation.

\item \texttt{DEWATERED}---If the DEWATERED keyword is specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.

\item \texttt{NEWTON}---keyword that activates the Newton-Raphson formulation for groundwater flow between connected, convertible groundwater cells. Cells will not dry when this option is used.

\item \texttt{FILEIN}---keyword to specify that an input filename is expected next.

\item \texttt{GNC6}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to a ghost-node correction file.

\item \texttt{gnc6\_filename}---is the file name for ghost node correction input file.  Information for the ghost nodes are provided in the file provided with these keywords.  The format for specifying the ghost nodes is the same as described for the GNC Package of the GWF Model.  This includes specifying OPTIONS, DIMENSIONS, and GNCDATA blocks.  The order of the ghost nodes must follow the same order as the order of the cells in the EXCHANGEDATA block.  For the GNCDATA, noden and all of the nodej values are assumed to be located in model 1, and nodem is assumed to be in model 2.

\item \texttt{MVR6}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to a mover file.

\item \texttt{mvr6\_filename}---is the file name of the water mover input file to apply to this exchange.  Information for the water mover are provided in the file provided with these keywords.  The format for specifying the water mover information is the same as described for the Water Mover (MVR) Package of the GWF Model, with two exceptions.  First, in the PACKAGES block, the model name must be included as a separate string before each package.  Second, the appropriate model name must be included before \texttt{pname1} and \texttt{pname2} in the BEGIN PERIOD block.  This allows providers and receivers to be located in both models listed as part of this exchange.

\item \texttt{OBS6}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to an observations file.

\item \texttt{obs6\_filename}---is the file name of the observations input file for this exchange. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for preparing observation input files. Table \ref{table:obstype} lists observation type(s) supported by the GWF-GWF package.

\item \texttt{nexg}---keyword and integer value specifying the number of GWF-GWF exchanges.

\item \texttt{cellidm1}---is the cellid of the cell in model 1 as specified in the simulation name file. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, \texttt{cellidm1} is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, \texttt{cellidm1} is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then \texttt{cellidm1} is the node number for the cell.

\item \texttt{cellidm2}---is the cellid of the cell in model 2 as specified in the simulation name file. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file, \texttt{cellidm2} is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.   For a grid that uses the DISV input file, \texttt{cellidm2} is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells.  If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then \texttt{cellidm2} is the node number for the cell.

\item \texttt{ihc}---is an integer flag indicating the direction between node n and all of its m connections. If $ihc=0$ then the connection is vertical.  If $ihc=1$ then the connection is horizontal. If $ihc=2$ then the connection is horizontal for a vertically staggered grid.

\item \texttt{cl1}---is the distance between the center of cell nodem1 and the its shared face with nodem2.

\item \texttt{cl2}---is the distance between the center of cell nodem2 and the its shared face with nodem1.

\item \texttt{hwva}---is the horizontal width of the flow connection between \texttt{nodem1} and \texttt{nodem2} if $\texttt{ihc} > 0$, or it is the area of the vertical connection between \texttt{nodem1} and \texttt{nodem2} if $\texttt{ihc} = 0$.

\item \texttt{aux}---represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each GWFGWF Exchange. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each exchange. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block.
