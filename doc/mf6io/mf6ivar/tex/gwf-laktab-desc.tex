\item \texttt{ncol}---integer value specifying the number of colums in the lake table. There must be \texttt{ncol} columns of data in the \texttt{TABLE} block. For lakes with \texttt{HORIZONTAL} and/or \texttt{VERTICAL} \texttt{ctype} connections, \texttt{NROW} must be equal to 3. For lakes with \texttt{EMBEDDEDH} or \texttt{EMBEDDEDV} \texttt{ctype} connections, \texttt{NROW} must be equal to 4.

\item \texttt{stage}---real value that defines the stage corresponding to the remaining data on the line.

\item \texttt{volume}---real value that defines the lake volume corresponding to the stage specified on the line.

\item \texttt{sarea}---real value that defines the lake surface area corresponding to the stage specified on the line.

\item \texttt{barea}---real value that defines the lake-\texttt{GWF} exchange area corresponding to the stage specified on the line. \texttt{barea} is only specified if the \texttt{claktype} for the lake is \texttt{EMBEDDEDH} or \texttt{EMBEDDEDV}.
