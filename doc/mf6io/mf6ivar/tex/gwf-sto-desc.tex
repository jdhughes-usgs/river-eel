\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that cell-by-cell flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{STORAGECOEFFICIENT}---keyword to indicate that the \texttt{ss} array is read as storage coefficient rather than specific storage.

\item \texttt{iconvert}---is a flag for each cell that specifies whether or not a cell is convertible for the storage calculation.  0 indicates confined storage is used. $>$0 indicates confined storage is used when head is above cell top and unconfined storage is used when head is below cell top.  A mixed formulation is when when a cell converts from confined to unconfined (or vice versa) during a single time step.

\item \texttt{ss}---is specific storage (or the storage coefficient if STORAGECOEFFICIENT is specified as an option).

\item \texttt{sy}---is specific yield.

\item \texttt{iper}---integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  \texttt{iper} must be less than \texttt{nper} in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The \texttt{iper} value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the \texttt{iper} value assigned for the previous block.

\item \texttt{STEADY-STATE}---keyword to indicate that stress-period \texttt{iper} is steady-state. Steady-state conditions will apply until the \texttt{TRANSIENT} keyword is specified in a subsequent \texttt{BEGIN PERIOD} block.

\item \texttt{TRANSIENT}---keyword to indicate that stress-period \texttt{iper} is transient. Transient conditions will apply until the \texttt{STEADY-STATE} keyword is specified in a subsequent \texttt{BEGIN PERIOD} block.
