\item \texttt{auxiliary}---defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   The number of auxiliary variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  Comments cannot be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary variable names.  Auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.

\item \texttt{cellid}---The keyword \texttt{`none'} must be specified for reaches that are not connected to an underlying GWF cell. The keyword \texttt{`none'} is used for reaches that are in cells that have \texttt{IDOMAIN} values less than one or are in areas not covered by the GWF model grid.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{aux}---represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each stream reach. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each stream reach. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block.  If the package supports time series and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \texttt{boundname}---name of the stream reach cell.  \texttt{boundname} is an ASCII character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters.  If \texttt{boundname} contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within single quotes.

\item \texttt{rno}---integer value that defines the reach number associated with the specified data on the line. \texttt{rno} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{MAXBOUND}.

\item \texttt{ic}---integer value that defines the reach number of the reach connected to the current reach and whether it is connected to the upstream or downstream end of the reach. Negative \texttt{ic} numbers indicate connected reaches are connected to the downstream end of the current reach. Positive \texttt{ic} numbers indicate connected reaches are connected to the upstream end of the current reach. The absolute value of \texttt{ic} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{MAXBOUND}.

\item \texttt{rno}---integer value that defines the reach number associated with the specified data on the line. \texttt{rno} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{MAXBOUND}.

\item \texttt{idv}---integer value that defines the downstream diversion number for the diversion for reach \texttt{rno}. \texttt{idv} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{ndv} for reach \texttt{rno}.

\item \texttt{iconr}---integer value that defines the downstream reach that will receive the diverted water. \texttt{idv} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{MAXBOUND}. Furthermore, reach  \texttt{iconr} must be a downstream connection for reach \texttt{rno}.

\item \texttt{cprior}---character string value that defines the the prioritization system for the diversion, such as when insufficient water is available to meet all diversion stipulations, and is used in conjunction with the value of \texttt{flow} value specified in the \texttt{STRESS\_PERIOD\_DATA} section. Available diversion options include:  (1) \texttt{cprior} = `FRACTION', then the amount of the diversion is computed as a fraction of the streamflow leaving reach \texttt{rno} ($Q_{DS}$); in this case, 0.0 $\le$ \texttt{divflow} $\le$ 1.0.  (2) \texttt{cprior} = `EXCESS', a diversion is made only if $Q_{DS}$ for reach \texttt{rno} exceeds the value of \texttt{divflow}. If this occurs, then the quantity of water diverted is the excess flow ($Q_{DS} -$ \texttt{divflow}) and $Q_{DS}$ from reach \texttt{rno} is set equal to \texttt{divflow}. This represents a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin and Hanson (2002). (3) \texttt{cprior} = `THRESHOLD', then if $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is less than the specified diversion flow (\texttt{divflow}), no water is diverted from reach \texttt{rno}. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is greater than or equal to (\texttt{divflow}), (\texttt{divflow}) is diverted and $Q_{DS}$ is set to the remainder ($Q_{DS} -$ \texttt{divflow})). This approach assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently low, diversions from the stream cease, and is the `priority' algorithm that originally was programmed into the STR1 Package (Prudic, 1989).  (4) \texttt{cprior} = `UPTO' -- if $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow (\texttt{divflow}), $Q_{DS}$ is reduced by \texttt{divflow}. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is less than (\texttt{divflow}), \texttt{divflow} is set to $Q_{DS}$ and there will be no flow available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach \texttt{rno}.

\item \texttt{iper}---integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  \texttt{iper} must be less than \texttt{nper} in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The \texttt{iper} value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the \texttt{iper} value assigned for the previous block.

\item \texttt{rno}---integer value that defines the reach number associated with the specified data on the line. \texttt{rno} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to \texttt{MAXBOUND}.

\item \texttt{sfrsetting}---line of information that is parsed into a keyword and values.  Keyword values that can be used to start the \texttt{sfrsetting} string include: \texttt{STATUS}, \texttt{MANNING}, \texttt{STAGE}, \texttt{INFLOW}, \texttt{RAINFALL}, \texttt{EVAPORATION}, \texttt{RUNOFF}, \texttt{DIVERSION}, \texttt{UPSTREAM\_FRACTION}, and \texttt{AUXILIARY}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=blockdefinition]
STATUS <status>
MANNING <@manning@>
STAGE <@stage@>
INFLOW <@inflow@>
RAINFALL <@rainfall@>
EVAPORATION <@evaporation@>
RUNOFF <@runoff@>
DIVERSION <idv> <@divrate@> 
UPSTREAM_FRACTION <upstream_fraction>
AUXILIARY <auxname> <@auxval@> 
\end{lstlisting}

\item \texttt{status}---keyword option to define stream reach status.  \texttt{status} can be \texttt{ACTIVE}, \texttt{INACTIVE}, or \texttt{SIMPLE}. The \texttt{SIMPLE} \texttt{status} option simulates streamflow using a user-specified stage for a reach or a stage set to the top of the reach (depth = 0). In cases where the simulated leakage calculated using the specified stage exceeds the sum of inflows to the reach, the stage is set to the top of the reach and leakage is set equal to the sum of inflows. Upstream factions should be changed using the \texttt{UPSTREAM\_FRACTION} \texttt{sfrsetting} if the status for one or more reaches is changed to \texttt{ACTIVE} or \texttt{INACTIVE}. For example, if one of two downstream connections for a reach is inactivated, the upstream fraction for the active and inactive downstream reach should be changed to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively, to ensure that the active reach receives all of the downstream outflow from the upstream reach. By default, \texttt{status} is \texttt{ACTIVE}.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{manning}---real or character value that defines the Manning's roughness coefficient for the reach. \texttt{manning} must be greater than zero.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{stage}---real or character value that defines the stage for the reach. The specified \texttt{stage} is only applied if the reach uses the simple routing option. If \texttt{STAGE} is not specified for reaches that use the simple routing option, the specified stage is set to the top of the reach. If the Options block includes a \texttt{TIMESERIESFILE} entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{inflow}---real or character value that defines the volumetric inflow rate for the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, inflow rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{rainfall}---real or character value that defines the  volumetric rate per unit area of water added by precipitation directly on the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, rainfall  rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{evaporation}---real or character value that defines the  volumetric rate per unit area of water subtracted by evaporation from the streamflow routing reach. A positive evaporation rate should be provided. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, evaporation rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{runoff}---real or character value that defines the volumetric rate of diffuse overland runoff that enters the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By default, runoff rates are zero for each reach.}

\item \texttt{DIVERSION}---keyword to indicate diversion record.

\item \texttt{idv}---diversion number.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{divrate}---real or character value that defines the volumetric diversion (\texttt{divflow}) rate for the streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \texttt{upstream\_fraction}---real value that defines the fraction of upstream flow (\texttt{ustrf}) from each upstream reach that is applied as upstream inflow to the reach. The sum of all \texttt{ustrf} values for all reaches connected to the same upstream reach must be equal to one.

\item \texttt{AUXILIARY}---keyword for specifying auxiliary variable.

\item \texttt{auxname}---name for the auxiliary variable to be assigned \texttt{auxval}.  \texttt{auxname} must match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the \texttt{OPTIONS} block. If \texttt{auxname} does not match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the \texttt{OPTIONS} block the data are ignored.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{auxval}---value for the auxiliary variable.  If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}
