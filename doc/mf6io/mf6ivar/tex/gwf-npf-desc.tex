\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that cell-by-cell flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{alternative\_cell\_averaging}---is a text keyword to indicate that an alternative method will be used for calculating the conductance for horizontal cell connections.  The text value for \texttt{alternative\_cell\_averaging} can be ``LOGARITHMIC'', ``AMT-LMK'', or ``AMT-HMK''.  ``AMT-LMK'' signifies that the conductance will be calculated using arithmetic-mean thickness and logarithmic-mean hydraulic conductivity.  ``AMT-HMK'' signifies that the conductance will be calculated using arithmetic-mean thickness and harmonic-mean hydraulic conductivity. If the user does not specify a value for \texttt{alternative\_cell\_averaging}, then the harmonic-mean method will be used.  This option cannot be used if the XT3D option is invoked.

\item \texttt{THICKSTRT}---indicates that cells having a negative \texttt{icelltype} are confined, and their cell thickness for conductance calculations will be computed as STRT-BOT rather than TOP-BOT.

\item \texttt{VARIABLECV}---keyword to indicate that the vertical conductance will be calculated using the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell and the thickness and properties of the underlying cell.  If the DEWATERED keyword is also specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.  If these keywords are not specified, then the default condition is to calculate the vertical conductance at the start of the simulation using the initial head and the cell properties.  The vertical conductance remains constant for the entire simulation.

\item \texttt{DEWATERED}---If the DEWATERED keyword is specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.

\item \texttt{PERCHED}---keyword to indicate that when a cell is overlying a dewatered convertible cell, the head difference used in Darcy's Law is equal to the head in the overlying cell minus the bottom elevation of the overlying cell.  If not specified, then the default is to use the head difference between the two cells.

\item \texttt{REWET}---activates model rewetting.  Rewetting is off by default.

\item \texttt{wetfct}---is a keyword and factor that is included in the calculation of the head that is initially established at a cell when that cell is converted from dry to wet.

\item \texttt{iwetit}---is a keyword and iteration interval for attempting to wet cells. Wetting is attempted every \texttt{iwetit} iteration. This applies to outer iterations and not inner iterations. If \texttt{iwetit} is specified as zero or less, then the value is changed to 1.

\item \texttt{ihdwet}---is a keyword and integer flag that determines which equation is used to define the initial head at cells that become wet.  If \texttt{ihdwet} is 0, $h = BOT + WETFCT (hm - BOT)$. If \texttt{ihdwet} is not 0, $h = BOT + WETFCT (THRESH)$.

\item \texttt{XT3D}---keyword indicating that the XT3D formulation will be used.  If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is also included, then the XT3D additional terms will be added to the right-hand side.  If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is excluded, then the XT3D terms will be put into the coefficient matrix.  Use of XT3D will substantially increase the computational effort, but will result in improved accuracy for anisotropic conductivity fields and for unstructured grids in which the CVFD requirement is violated.

\item \texttt{RHS}---If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is also included, then the XT3D additional terms will be added to the right-hand side.  If the \texttt{RHS} keyword is excluded, then the XT3D terms will be put into the coefficient matrix.

\item \texttt{icelltype}---flag for each cell that specifies how saturated thickness is treated.  0 means saturated thickness is held constant;  $>$0 means saturated thickness varies with computed head when head is below the cell top; $<$0 means saturated thickness varies with computed head unless the THICKSTRT option is in effect.  When THICKSTRT is in effect, a negative value of icelltype indicates that saturated thickness will be computed as STRT-BOT and held constant.

\item \texttt{k}---is the hydraulic conductivity.  When anisotropy is applied, \texttt{k} corresponds to the $K_{11}$ tensor component.  All included cells ($\texttt{IDOMAIN} > 0$) must have a \texttt{k} value greater than zero.

\item \texttt{k22}---is the hydraulic conductivity of second ellipsoid axis; for an unrotated case this is the hydraulic conductivity in the y direction.  If \texttt{k22} is not included in the GRIDDATA block, then $k22$ is equal to $k$.  For a regular grid in which no rotation angles are specified, \texttt{k22} is the hydraulic conductivity along columns in the y direction. For an unstructured grid, the user must assign principal x and y axes and provide the angle for each cell connection relative to the assumed x direction.  All included cells ($\texttt{IDOMAIN} > 0$) must have a \texttt{k22} value greater than zero.

\item \texttt{k33}---is the hydraulic conductivity of third ellipsoid axis; for an unrotated case, this is the vertical hydraulic conductivity.  When anisotropy is applied, \texttt{k33} corresponds to the $K_{33}$ tensor component.  All included cells ($\texttt{IDOMAIN} > 0$) must have a \texttt{k33} value greater than zero.

\item \texttt{wetdry}---is a combination of the wetting threshold and a flag to indicate which neighboring cells can cause a cell to become wet. If \texttt{wetdry} $<$ 0, only a cell below a dry cell can cause the cell to become wet. If \texttt{wetdry} $>$ 0, the cell below a dry cell and horizontally adjacent cells can cause a cell to become wet. If \texttt{wetdry} is 0, the cell cannot be wetted. The absolute value of \texttt{wetdry} is the wetting threshold. When the sum of BOT and the absolute value of \texttt{wetdry} at a dry cell is equaled or exceeded by the head at an adjacent cell, the cell is wetted.  \texttt{wetdry} must be specified if ``REWET'' is specified in the OPTIONS block.  If ``REWET'' is not specified in the options block, then \texttt{wetdry} can be entered, and memory will be allocated for it, even though it is not used.

\item \texttt{angle1}---is rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees.  The angle represents the counter-clockwise rotation of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid within the $x-y$ plane.  A value of zero, which is the default value if \texttt{angle1} is not specified, indicates that $K_{11}$ is aligned with the x-axis of the model grid (the row direction for a regular grid) and $K_{22}$ is aligned with the y-axis of the model grid (the column direction for a regular grid).

\item \texttt{angle2}---is rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees.  The angle represents the tilt of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid up and out of the $x-y$ plane.

\item \texttt{angle3}---is rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity tensor in degrees.  The angle represents the rotation of the hydraulic conductivity tensor around its dominant axis.
